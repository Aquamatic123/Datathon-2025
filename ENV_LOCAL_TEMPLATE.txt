# Aurora DSQL Configuration - .env.local Template
# ===========================
# This file shows the CORRECT environment variable names
# Copy these to your .env.local file

# Aurora DSQL Endpoint (hostname only, no protocol or query parameters)
AURORA_DSQL_ENDPOINT=dbtjczatkd7mblohlvaxccqpg4.dsql.us-west-2.on.aws

# AWS Region where your Aurora DSQL cluster is located
APP_REGION=us-west-2

# Database name to connect to
DATABASE_NAME=postgres

# AWS Access Key ID with DSQL permissions (mark as SECRET in Amplify)
APP_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA6ODVAJ2DK6HO7M6I

# AWS Secret Access Key (mark as SECRET in Amplify)
APP_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key-here

# ===========================
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# ===========================
# ✓ Use APP_* variable names (not AWS_*)
# ✓ The code now explicitly passes credentials to AWS SDK
# ✓ Your .env.local file is ignored by Git
# ✓ Same variables work for local development AND AWS Amplify
