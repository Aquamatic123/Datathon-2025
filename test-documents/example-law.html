        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            This act establishes comprehensive data privacy protections for consumers
            in the digital age. It requires technology companies to obtain explicit
            consent before collecting personal data, provides consumers with the right
            to access and delete their data, and imposes significant penalties for
            data breaches.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The law has significant implications for major technology companies,
            particularly those involved in social media, data analytics, and
            cloud computing. Companies must implement new compliance measures
            within 180 days of enactment.
